These researchers receive a guaranteed fee for participation and additional reward for every valid bug found. Project assets are only visible to the whitelisted researchers.**\n\nIonic introduces a new feature. It consists of leveraging positions of the lending platform by repeatedly borrowing and supplying by looping over the assets. The main code of the project is a Compound/Rari fork, but the in-scope feature is completely unique. \n\nFor more information about Ionic, please visit [https://www.ionic.money/](https://www.ionic.money/). \n\nIonic provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD.",

If no valid bugs are found then the reward pool will be distributed between whitehats or returned to the project at Immunefi’s discretion. \n\nFor this Invite Only Program, duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward. \n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/).\n\nRewards will be distributed all at once based on Immunefi’s distribution formula after the event has concluded and the final bug reports have been resolved.\n\n**Insight Rewards Payment Terms**\n\nInsight Rewards: Portion of the Rewards Pool\n\n* The \"Insight\" severity was introduced on Boost & Attackathon programs to recognize contributions that extend beyond identifying immediate vulnerabilities. Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report. However, our team or program will designate it accordingly if applicable. \"Insights\" underscores our commitment to valuing all types of contributions that contribute to a more secure environment and will always be rewarded.

If so, which? And what are the main differences?**\n\nNo, this is a unique code. \n\n**What ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC777 / ERC1155 token standards are supported? Which are not?**\n\nERC20 only\n\n**What external dependencies are there?**\n\nThere is an external dependency on DEXs as the code uses external DEXs to swap. \n\n**Where might whitehats confuse out-of-scope code to be in-scope?**\n\nThe code is deployed as a diamond pattern upgradable contract. It is built as an external feature on top of the lending pools\n\n**Where do you suspect there may be bugs?**\n\nMainly the interaction between this code and the existing lending pool code, as for how it does lending and borrowing calculations. \n\n**What is the test suite setup information?**\n\nUsing Forge test scripts, mostly all of them are basic scripts.\n\n**Asset Accuracy Assurance**\n\nBugs found on assets incorrectly listed in-scope will be considered valid and be rewarded.\n\n**Private Known Issues Reward Policy**\n\nPrivate known issues, meaning known issues that were not publicly disclosed, are valid for a reward.\n\n**Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules**\n\nIonic adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page.",

In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.\n\nTherefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.\n\n**Immunefi Standard Badge**\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Hinkal has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209-The-Immunefi-Standard-Badge).",
