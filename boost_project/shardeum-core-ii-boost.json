Shardeum is a large project and as such, will be split over two concurrent boosts. This boost, will cover the Web3 aspects of the project. This will cover two components: Shardus Core Protocol and Shardeum Validator Nodes.\n\nFor more information about Shardeum, please visit [https://shardeum.org/](https://shardeum.org/).\n\nShardeum provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD.",

      "rewardsBody": "The following reward terms are a summary, for the full details read our [Shardeum Core II Reward Terms](zd)\n\nThe reward pool will be entirely distributed among participants. The size depends on the bugs found:\n- If one or more Critical severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 100% of the respective reward pool, $150,000 USD **\n- If one or more High severity bugs are found,** the reward pool will be 75% of the respective reward pool, $112,500 USD**\n- If one or more Medium severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 50% of the respective reward pool, $75,000 USD**\n- If Low severity bugs or no bugs are found,** the reward pool will be 25% of the respective reward pool, $37,500 USD **\n\n**Duplicates of Insight reports are not eligible for a reward. **\n\nFor this Boost, duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward. \n\nPrivate known issues will unlock higher reward pools according to their severity level without any downgrade. For example, a Critical severity bug which was a private known issue would unlock the reward pool conditional on a Critical severity bug being found.\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi [Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Shardeum team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.\n\nRewards will be distributed all at once based on Immunefi’s distribution formula after the event has concluded and the final bug reports have been resolved.\n\n__Insight Rewards Payment Terms__\n\nInsight Rewards: Portion of the Rewards Pool\n\nThe \"Insight\" severity was introduced on Boost & Attackathon programs to recognize contributions that extend beyond identifying immediate vulnerabilities. Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report. However, our team or program will designate it accordingly if applicable. \"Insights\" underscores our commitment to valuing all types of contributions that contribute to a more secure environment and will always be rewarded.

      "assetsBodyV2": "Shardeum’s up to date codebase can be found at [https://github.com/shardeum/](https://github.com/shardeum/).\n\nA note on Shardeum and Shardus Core scope: the default config in the dev branch is in scope. Whitehats are free to configure, patch, and modify their own malicious nodes however they want. However, target nodes must be running the default config in dev. This is to prevent the whitehats from wasting time reporting things we specifically allow in debug mode. The only exception is minNodes and maxNodes settings, which allow different size networks to be created. Certain vulnerabilities may only exist in certain network sizes, and we do not wish to limit Whitehat activity and participation for lack of computing power attempting to run a large local network. However, network-wide attacks that only work under 128 nodes may be rejected or reduced in severity at our discretion. If the researchers can enable debug mode options remotely then that is valid and can be paid out.\n\nAttacks that require the network to still be initializing/bootstrapping are out of scope. Wait until the network mode reaches “processing” + 15 cycles after startup before launching attacks. The rules for staking/join are a little different and the network will not be public during this time. Attacks on a network that is repairing itself (was once in “processing” mode but has since degraded to “safety” or “recovery”) are in scope.\n\nAttacks that require lots of network traffic, large messages, or many connections are at risk of being degraded to insight.\n\n0day vulnerabilities in dependencies will have a max impact of insight. Any other vuln in dependencies is out of scope.\n\nAny report based on unit tests, simulations, or anything not a fully functioning network, will have a max impact of low.\n\nSmart contracts are out of scope\n\nFinally, the more nodes that are required to launch an attack, the more at risk the vuln is of being downgraded. If it takes 33% (for example) of the nodes in the network being malicious to cause damage, then it becomes difficult to distinguish the impact from a brute-force/51% attack, which is completely out of scope.\n\n__Mid-Contest Code Updates__\n\nIn this contest bug fixes may be applied mid-contest. This is required for Shardeum to test changes on their beta networks in preparation for an imminent mainnet launch.\n\nThe project is to keep changes private as far as possible. When changes need to be made public, then the changelog will be updated here & in the [Shardeum Boost Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/immunefi?utm_source=immunefi). Publicly fixed bugs are invalid and the scope is updated to the new code.\n\nAll bug reports before the fix was public will earn a reward. All bug reports after are invalid. If a new bug is introduced by their fix then it is valid for a reward.\n\n__Mid-Contest Changelog__",
