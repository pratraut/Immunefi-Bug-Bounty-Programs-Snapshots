Shardeum is a large project and as such, will be split over two concurrent boosts. This boost, called Ancillaries, will cover the Web2 aspects of the project.\n\nFor more information about Shardeum, please visit [https://shardeum.org/](https://shardeum.org/).\n\nShardeum provides rewards in USDC, denominated in USD.",

      "rewardsBody": "The following reward terms are a summary, for the full details read our [Shardeum Ancillaries II Boost Reward Terms](zd)\n\nThe reward pool will be entirely distributed among participants. The size depends on the bugs found:\n- If one or more Critical severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 100% of the respective reward pool, $100,000 USD**\n- If one or more High severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 75% of the respective reward pool, $75,000 USD **\n- If one or more Medium severity bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 50% of the respective reward pool, $50,000 USD**\n- If Low severity bugs or no bugs are found, **the reward pool will be 25% of the respective reward pool, $25,000 USD**\n\n**Duplicates of Insight reports are not eligible for a reward. **\n\nFor this Boost, duplicates and private known issues are valid for a reward. \n\nPrivate known issues will unlock higher reward pools according to their severity level without any downgrade. For example, a Critical severity bug which was a private known issue would unlock the reward pool conditional on a Critical severity bug being found.\n\nRewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi [Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/). \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Shardeum team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in USDC.\n\nRewards will be distributed all at once based on Immunefi’s distribution formula after the event has concluded and the final bug reports have been resolved.\n\n__Insight Rewards Payment Terms__\n\nInsight Rewards: Portion of the Rewards Pool\n\nThe \"Insight\" severity was introduced on Boost & Attackathon programs to recognize contributions that extend beyond identifying immediate vulnerabilities. Currently, it's not an option to select the Insight severity when submitting a report. However, our team or program will designate it accordingly if applicable. \"Insights\" underscores our commitment to valuing all types of contributions that contribute to a more secure environment and will always be rewarded.
