All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.\n\n__Smart Contracts__\n\nCritical\n  - Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of funds\n  - Protocol Insolvency\n\nHigh\n  - Theft of unclaimed yield\n  - Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield\n  - Temporary freezing of funds for at least 48 hours\n\nMedium\n  - Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds \n  - Unbounded gas consumption",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.\n\nAll  bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.\n\nRewards for critical smart contract vulnerabilities are further capped at 10% of economic damage, with the main consideration being the funds affected in addition to PR and brand considerations, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of __USD 50 000__ for Critical smart contract bug reports. \n\nPrevious issues highlighted in the following audit reports are considered out of scope of this program: \n  - [https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/halborn/StaderLabs_MaticX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf ](https://github.com/stader-labs/audits/blob/main/halborn/StaderLabs_MaticX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf)\n  - [https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/polygon/StaderLabs_maticX_Audit_Report_Immunebytes.pdf](https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/polygon/StaderLabs_maticX_Audit_Report_Immunebytes.pdf)\n\nPayouts are handled by the __Stader for Polygon__ team directly and are denominated in USD.
