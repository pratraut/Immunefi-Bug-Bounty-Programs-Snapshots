Unlike other Bitcoin projects, only Bitcoin SV has the plan for a stable protocol and plan for massive on-chain scaling to become the worldâ€™s new money and the global public blockchain for enterprise.\n\nThe bug bounty program is focused around the code base for BSV and spans end-to-end, ranging from the soundness of protocols (blockchain consensus model, the wire and p2p protocols, proof of work, etc.), protocol implementation, and compliance to network security and consensus integrity.",

This proof of concept should be code.\n\nPayouts are handled by the [Bitcoin Association for BSV](https://bitcoinassociation.net) directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in __BSV__.",
