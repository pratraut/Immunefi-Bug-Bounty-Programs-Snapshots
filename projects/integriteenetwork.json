      "programOverview": "Integritee is a highly scalable, privacy-enabling network in the Polkadot ecosystem with parachains on Polkadot and Kusama. We seek to become the leading Web3 privacy solution - a blockchain network for developers and relevant to enterprises to build (decentralized) applications that benefit from unrivaled speed, verifiable confidentiality/privacy, and interoperability. At scale.\n\nOur solution combines the security and trust of Polkadot, the scalability of second-layer solutions, and the confidentiality of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) - a special-purpose hardware inside which computations run securely, confidentially, and verifiably. Our technology is relevant to both Web3 developers and enterprises who would like to benefit from verifiable privacy and public auditability. \n\nFor more information about Integritee Network, please visit https://www.integritee.network/\n\nIntegritee Network provides rewards in TEER, denominated in USD. For more details about the payment process, please view the Rewards by Threat Level section further below. \n\n\n__Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules__\n\n- Integritee Network adheres to the Primacy of Rules, which means that the whole bug bounty program is run strictly under the terms and conditions stated within this page. \n\n__Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements__\n\n- A PoC, demonstrating the bug's impact, is required for this program and has to comply with the [Immunefi PoC Guidelines and Rules.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9946217628561-Proof-of-Concept-PoC-Guidelines-and-Rules)\n\n\n__Public Disclosure of Known Issues__\n\n-Bug reports covering previously-discovered bugs (listed below) are not eligible for a reward within this program. This includes known issues that the project is aware of but has consciously decided not to “fix”, necessary code changes, or any implemented operational mitigating procedures that can lessen potential risk. \n\n- https://github.com/integritee-network/worker/labels/F1-security\n- https://github.com/integritee-network/pallets/labels/F1-security\n\n\n__Immunefi Standard Badge__\n\nBy adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Integritee Network has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209)",
      "prioritizedVulnerabilities": "Only the following impacts are accepted within this bug bounty program. All other impacts are not considered as in-scope, even if they affect something in the assets in scope table.",
      "rewardsBody": "Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3. ](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)\n\n__Repeatable Attack Limitations__\n\nIf the function where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attack will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk. \n\n__Reward Payment Terms__\n\nPayouts are handled by the Integritee Network team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in TEER.\n\nThe calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the average price between CoinMarketCap.com and CoinGecko.com at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.",
